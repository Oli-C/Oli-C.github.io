    <h3 class="margin">Resources</h3>

    <br>

    <p>
        Over the last 25 years, plenty of excellent resources for learning and discovering sonification have been
        created. Here is a collation of the best resources.
    </p>

    <h5 class="margin">The Sonification Handbook</h5>

    <p>
        This book is a comprehensive introductory presentation of the key research areas in the interdisciplinary fields
        of sonification and auditory display. Chapters are written by leading experts, providing a wide-range coverage
        of the central issues, and can be read from start to finish, or dipped into as required (like a smorgasbord
        menu). Giving a solid introduction to the field of auditory display, the techniques for sonification, suitable
        technologies for developing sonification algorithms, and the most promising application areas. The book is
        accompanied by the online repository of sound examples.
    </p>

    <h5 class="margin">Sonification Design: From Data to Intelligible Soundfields
    </h5>

    <p>
        This book is about the contemporary design practice known as data sonification, which assists us to experience information by listening, much as we understand relationships between spatial features by viewing a graph of them. Data sonification begins with the observation that sounds can convey meanings in a multiplicity of circumstances: Exploring the structure of deep space, detecting a stock-market bubble, assisting injured patients to recover more quickly with less pain, monitoring the flow of traffic to help detect potential congestion, improving sporting perfor- mance, tracking storms, earthquakes and other changes in the environment ... and the list could go on: hundreds of applications that rely on studies in acoustics and psychoacoustics, philosophy of perception, cognitive psychology, computer sci- ence, creative auditory design and music composition.
