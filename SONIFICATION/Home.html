    <p>
        This website is designed to provide a guide to the various techniques used within the research field of
        sonification. It also explores relevant projects, interactive demos in iOS and current research.

    <p>
        Visual representations are considered to be the usual method for interpreting large datasets. Generally, visual
        representations consist of graphs, diagrams or spectrograms. However, we do not interpret information in the
        world using only vision and hearing is one of the many human senses used for interpretation.

        The earliest use of sound to convey information is thought to have existed within Ancient Egypt. According to
        Brown \cite{Boyd}, Ancient Egyptian auditors compared the ‘soundness’ of commodities moving in and out of stores
        to ensure fair trading. While this is a primitive example, the acknowledgement of sound to convey information
        and research into the field of sonification has only been around for roughly 25 years \cite{Worrall}. Visual
        representations have been used for a longer period of time than auditory representations due to audio technology
        only developing since the 19th century such as the invention of the Reis Transmitter by Johann Philipp Reis in
        1862 \cite{aes}. The Reis Transmitter, shown in figure \ref{fig:reis}, is regarded as one of the earliest
        developments of a telephone-like device \cite{notBell}.

        Visual displays have been around much longer than computer audio cards. The earliest visual monitors date back
        to the 1970s, around 20 years before the first audio cards in the 1990s and further real-time sound processing
        capabilities in the 21st century.

    <p>
        The terms ‘sonification’, ‘auditory display’ and ‘data sonification’ are used interchangeably within research
        articles and journals. All three terms are used to express methods to represent information as sound
        \cite{Worrall}.

        There have been many attempts to define sonification. Notably in 1999, Gregory Kramer defined sonification as:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
        "The use of non-speech audio to convey information. More specifically, sonification is the transformation of data
        relations into perceived relations in an acoustic signal for the purposes of facilitating communication or
        interpretation."
